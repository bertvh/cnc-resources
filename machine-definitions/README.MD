#Machine Definitions

Contains machine definitions for Fusion360. They are probably compatible with many Autodesk products.

Upload a machine definition in your [Fusion 360 Assets/CAMMachines](https://myhub.autodesk360.com) folder. At the moment
of writing Fusion 360 doens't seem to allow you to pick a clound machine. Workaround: select any machine, then `edit >
load > select the machine file`.
