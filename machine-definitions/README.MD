#Machine Definitions

Contains machine definitions for Fusion360. They are probably compatible with many Autodesk products.

## Usage

**Option 1 (doesn't work yet)** Upload a machine definition in your [Fusion 360 Assets/CAMMachines](https://myhub.autodesk360.com) folder. At the moment
of writing Fusion 360 doens't seem to allow you to pick a clound machine. 

**Option 2** In your CAM setup, select *any* machine, then click `edit >
load > select the machine file`,.
